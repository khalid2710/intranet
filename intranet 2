An intranet is a computer network for sharing information, easier communication, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services within an organization, usually to the exclusion of access by outsiders.  The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses the same technology based on the Internet protocol suite.
An organization-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration and provide a single starting point  access internal and external resources.
